## Blockchain concepts learnt through this assignment

### 1. Smart contracts

Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss.These actions could include releasing funds to the appropriate parties, registering a vehicle, sending notifications, or issuing a ticket. The blockchain is then updated when the transaction is completed. That means the transaction cannot be changed, and only parties who have been granted permission can see the results.

### 2. Distributed ledger

How distributed ledger is implemented using peers and orderers, how consensus is achieved using algorithms like Raft and how the distributed ledger is maintained.

Also learnt about hyperledger-fabric related things like channels, chain-nodes etc.
